# Thesis Chapter Tracker

I've recently been writing all my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which I like for a couple reasons:

<!-- more -->

- My notes are saved as locally stored markdown files so I don't need Obsidian to make sense of them
- It has native apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, and iPhone, all of which I use because something is wrong with me
- It has a lot of plugins so if there's something I want to do with it there's a good chance someone has already made a plugin for it.

The two plugins I currently have installed and recommend are:

- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview): Makes tables and stuff based on information stored in notes. This is how I make my thesis progress tracker table!
- [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git): Let's me backup my notes to git automatically, which functions as a combined version control and cloud sync for notes. Important since I access my notes on four different operating systems ðŸ¤ª

Once you've got Dataview installed, make a note for each chapter in your thesis, or for whatever you want a single row in your table to be.
